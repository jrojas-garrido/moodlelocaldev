/*
 *  Aardvark
 *
 *  The original menubar based theme for Moodle rewritten for Moodle 2.9+ to draw
 *  its base from Bootstrap.
 *
 *  Aardvark has evolved over the past 10 years as Moodle has integrated the
 *  features that have made Aardvark so popular into its core system, including
 *  custom menu and user menu.
 *
 *  The theme now features a simple flat look with inspiration taken from Flat UI
 *  and Google's material design.
